# Software Project Documentation Template

This workspace provides a **complete template** to manage the entire documentation lifecycle of a software project, from initial definition to structural design.

## üéØ How to Use This Template

1. **Clone** this repository
2. **Customize** the template files according to your specific project
3. **Replace** placeholders like `[Project Name]`, `[Description]`, etc. with your data
4. **Delete** sections that are not necessary for your project
5. **Add** specific diagrams and documentation

## üöÄ How to Get Started

1. **Define the Project**: Complete all templates in `01-project-definition/` (description, stakeholders, objectives, scope, risks)
2. **Gather Hierarchical Requirements**: Structure user stories and requirements in `02-requirements/` using the category hierarchy
3. **Create Behavioral Diagrams**: Model use cases, activities, and sequences in `03-behavioral-diagrams/`
4. **Design the Architecture**: Develop system architecture, class, and component diagrams in `04-structural-diagrams/`
5. **Design the Data Model**: Complete with ER diagrams and data dictionary in `05-database-design/`

## üìã Template Development Workflow

### üéØ Phase 1: Foundation (01-project-definition/)
```
Project Description ‚Üí Stakeholder Analysis ‚Üí SMART Objectives ‚Üí 
Scope Definition ‚Üí Risk Assessment
```

### üìã Phase 2: Requirements (02-requirements/)
```
Epic Stories ‚Üí Functional Requirements (by category) ‚Üí 
Non-Functional Requirements ‚Üí Acceptance Criteria (structured)
```

### üé≠ Phase 3: Behavioral Design (03-behavioral-diagrams/)
```
Use Case Modeling ‚Üí Business Process Flows ‚Üí 
System Interaction Sequences
```

### üèóÔ∏è Phase 4: Structural Design (04-structural-diagrams/)
```
System Architecture ‚Üí OOP Class Design ‚Üí 
Component Architecture & Deployment
```

### üíæ Phase 5: Data Design (05-database-design/)
```
Conceptual ER Model ‚Üí Logical Data Model ‚Üí 
Data Dictionary & Business Rules
```

> üí° **Pro Tip**: Each README provides detailed guides, common patterns, and anti-patterns to accelerate development.

## üìù Notes

- All files are **reusable templates** with placeholders to be customized
- PlantUML diagrams include syntax examples and best practices
- Follow standard UML conventions to maintain consistency
- Use unique IDs for traceability between documents

## üîß Using the Enterprise Template

### Quick Start
1. **Clone/Fork** this repository for your project
2. **Read the READMEs** in each folder to understand the structure and best practices
3. **Start with 01-project-definition/** following the numerical order of the folders
4. **Customize the templates** by replacing placeholders with your project's data
5. **Use the provided patterns** in the multi-domain examples as a reference

### Advanced Customization
- **Multi-domain Examples**: Adapt the E-commerce/Banking/Healthcare examples to your industry
- **Scaling**: Use the hierarchical structure for projects of any size
- **Tool Integration**: Compatible with Jira, Confluence, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues
- **Enterprise Standards**: Integrates SMART objectives, MoSCoW prioritization, RACI matrices

### Governance and Traceability
