## 🎯 Methodology and Framework

### User Stories Format
```
As a [type of user]
I want [feature/goal]
So that [benefit/value]
```

### SMART Requirements
- **Specific**: Specific and clear
- **Measurable**: Quantitatively measurable
- **Achievable**: Technically feasible
- **Relevant**: Relevant to the business
- **Time-bound**: With defined timelines

### MoSCoW Prioritization

- **Could Have**: Nice-to-have requirements for future versions
- **Won't Have**: Requirements excluded from this version

## 🔗 Complete Traceability

### Forward Traceability
```
Business Objectives → User Stories → Requirements →
Acceptance Criteria → Test Cases → Code
```

### Backward Traceability
```
Code → Test Cases → Acceptance Criteria →
Requirements → User Stories → Business Objectives
```

### Horizontal Traceability
```
User Stories ↔ Functional Requirements ↔ 
Non-Functional Requirements ↔ Acceptance Criteria
```

## 📊 Traceability Matrix

| User Story | Functional Req. | Non-Func. Req. | Acceptance Crit. | Status |
|------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| US-001     | REQ-F-001       | REQ-NF-PERF-001 | AC-F-001, AC-NF-001 | ✅      |
| US-002     | REQ-F-002       | REQ-NF-SEC-001  | AC-F-002, AC-NF-002 | ⏳      |

## 🚀 Management Workflow

### 1. Epic Planning
- Identification of epics from the backlog
- Definition of epic goals and scope
- Breakdown into user stories

### 2. User Story Creation
- Writing user stories in standard format
- Definition of acceptance criteria
- Estimation of story points
- Prioritization

### 3. Requirements Analysis
- Derivation of functional requirements from user stories
- Identification of non-functional requirements
- Categorization and prioritization
- Stakeholder review

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Definition
- Definition of testable criteria
- Linking with requirements
- Review with QA team
- Final approval

### 5. Validation & Testing
- Feature implementation
- Testing against criteria
- User acceptance testing
- Final sign-off

## 📋 Templates and Standards

### Available Templates
- **Epic Template**: `epic-template/README.md`
- **User Story Template**: `epic-template/US-XXX-template.md`
- **Functional Requirement**: `functional-requirements/core-features/REQ-F-XXX-template.md`
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: `non-functional-requirements/REQ-NF-XXX-template.md`

### Naming Conventions
- **File**: `[ID]-[short-name].md`
- **Folders**: `[category]-[name]` (e.g., `epic-authentication`)
- **ID**: Progressive numbering by category

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- **Maintain traceability** between all elements
- **Use standardized templates** for consistency
- **Regularly review** with stakeholders
- **Update status** as you proceed
- **Document decisions** and motivations

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't create requirements** not linked to user stories
- **Don't be vague** in descriptions
- **Don't forget** non-functional requirements
- **Don't proceed** without stakeholder approval
- **Don't neglect** acceptance criteria

## 🔄 Change Management

### Modification Process
1. **Change Request**: Documented request for modification
2. **Impact Analysis**: Analysis of impact on other elements
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Review and approval
4. **Update Dependencies**: Update of linked elements
5. **Communication**: Communication of changes

### Version Control
- Each document must have a change history table
- Formal approvals documented
- Requirements baseline for milestones
