# Non-Functional Requirements

This folder contains all the non-functional requirements of the system, organized by quality category.

## 📋 Overview

**Non-Functional Requirements** define the qualities of the system: how it should perform, how secure, usable, reliable, etc., it must be. These requirements are often called "ilities" and are critical to the system's success.

## 🔗 NFR Traceability

### Forward Traceability
NFR → Architecture Decisions → Design Patterns → Implementation → Testing

### Backward Traceability
Business Goals → User Needs → Quality Attributes → NFR

### Horizontal Traceability
NFR ↔ Functional Requirements ↔ User Stories ↔ Test Cases

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- **Always quantify** when possible
- **Use industry standard metrics**
- **Link to business objectives**
- **Plan specific testing** for each NFR
- **Consider trade-offs** between different qualities

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't be vague** ("the system must be fast")
- **Don't ignore** technical limitations
- **Don't forget** the cost of implementation
- **Don't underestimate** the impact on other requirements
- **Don't postpone** validation

*Non-functional requirements are often more difficult to implement than functional ones, but they are what determine the success or failure of the system.*
