## 🧪 Integration Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path - Successful Integration
**Objective**: To verify the normal operation of the integration

**Given** the source system has valid data
**And** the target system is available
**And** the connection is established correctly
**When** a standard integration request is sent
**Then** the data must be transferred correctly
**And** the target system must confirm receipt
**And** the response must be received within [X] seconds
**And** the mapped data must match the expected schema

### Scenario 2: Error Handling - System Unavailable
**Objective**: To verify error handling when the target system is unavailable

**Given** the source system has valid data
**And** the target system is unavailable/offline
**When** the integration is attempted
**Then** the system must detect the unavailability
**And** it must activate the configured retry logic
**And** it must log the error appropriately
**And** it must notify the monitoring systems of the error
**And** the data must be preserved for subsequent retries

### Scenario 3: Data Validation - Invalid Input
**Objective**: To verify input data validation

**Given** the target system is available
**And** invalid data is provided from the source system
**When** the integration is attempted
**Then** the system must detect the invalid data
**And** it must refuse processing
**And** it must return a descriptive error
**And** it must log the details of the failed validation
**And** it must not compromise the integrity of the target system

### Scenario 4: Performance Under Load
**Objective**: To verify the integration's performance under load

**Given** both systems are operational
**And** a load of [X] simultaneous requests is generated
**When** the integration requests are processed
**Then** the throughput must be >= [Y] transactions/minute
**And** the average response time must be <= [Z] seconds
**And** no timeout errors should occur
**And** system resources must remain within limits

### Scenario 5: Transaction Rollback
**Objective**: To verify rollback management in case of failure

**Given** a multi-step integration transaction has started
**And** an intermediate step fails
**When** the failure is detected
**Then** all previous steps must be rolled back
**And** the systems must return to the pre-transaction state
**And** the reason for the rollback must be logged
**And** any locks must be released
