## üìù How to Use the Template

### 1. Identify the Integration Type
```bash
# API Integration
AC-I-API-001-payment-gateway.md

# Database Integration
AC-I-DB-001-user-sync.md

# Message Queue
AC-I-MQ-001-order-events.md

# External Service

```

### 2. Define the Integration Contract
- **Input Schema**: Format of data sent
- **Output Schema**: Format of data received
- **Protocol Details**: HTTP methods, headers, auth
- **Error Handling**: Error codes and recovery

### 3. Specify Test Scenarios
- **Happy Path**: Integration works correctly
- **Error Conditions**: Handling of failures and timeouts
- **Load Testing**: Performance under load
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization

## üõ†Ô∏è Tested Integration Patterns

### Synchronous Integration
```gherkin
Given the destination system is available
When I send a synchronous request
Then I receive a response within X seconds
And the response contains the expected data
```

### Asynchronous Integration
```gherkin
Given the message broker is operational
When I publish a message to the queue
Then the message is processed
And I receive an acknowledgment
And the consumer processes the message
```

### Batch Integration
```gherkin
Given I have a batch file to process
When I start the import process
Then all valid records are processed
And invalid records are logged
And a completion report is generated
```

### Event-Driven Integration
```gherkin
Given the system is listening for events
When a business event occurs
Then the event is published
And all subscribers receive the event
And they process the event appropriately
```

## üß™ Common Test Scenarios

### Connectivity Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify basic connection
Given the credentials are configured
When I test the connectivity
Then the connection is established successfully
And I receive a health check response
```

### Data Exchange Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Correct data exchange
Given I have valid data to transmit
When I send the data to the external system
Then the data is transmitted correctly
And I receive confirmation of receipt
And the data maintains integrity
```

### Error Handling Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Network error handling
Given the external system is temporarily unavailable
When I attempt to send data
Then I receive an appropriate timeout error
And the error is logged
And the retry logic is activated
```

### Performance Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Performance under load
Given I am sending X simultaneous requests
When I run the load test
Then all requests are processed within Y seconds
And the success rate is ‚â• Z%
And no memory leaks occur
```

### Security Testing
```gherkin
Scenario: Secure authentication
Given I have valid credentials
When I authenticate with the external system
Then authentication is successful
And I receive a valid token
And the token has an appropriate expiration
```
