# Functional Acceptance Criteria

This folder contains the acceptance criteria to validate that the implemented features meet the specific functional requirements.

## üìã Purpose of Functional Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Acceptance Criteria** are used to:
- Verify that features behave as specified
- Validate business logic and application workflows
- Test input/output and data processing
- Confirm that functional requirements are implemented correctly

## üéØ When to Use this Template

### Ideal Scenarios
- **Feature Completion**: When a new feature is implemented
- **Business Logic Testing**: To validate complex business rules
- **Data Processing**: To test data processing and transformations
- **Workflow Validation**: To verify operational flows
- **Integration Points**: To test functional integration points

### Types of Functionality Covered
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Business Workflows**: Multi-step business processes
- **Data Validation**: Input checks and business rules
- **Calculations**: Calculation and processing logic
- **State Management**: State and transition management

## üìù How to Use the Template

### 1. Copy and Rename
```bash
# Copy the template
cp AC-F-XXX-template.md AC-F-001-user-login.md

# Example naming convention
AC-F-{AREA}-{NUMBER}-{description}.md
```

### 2. Fill in the Main Sections
- **General Information**: ID, category, priority
- **Feature Description**: What the system should do
- **Test Scenarios**: Given/When/Then scenarios
- **Detailed Criteria**: Specific checklist
- **Traceability**: Links to requirements and user stories

### 3. Focus on Behaviors
Focus on **WHAT** the system should do, not **HOW**:
- ‚úÖ "The system must validate the email format"
- ‚ùå "The system must use regex for email"

## üß™ Test Scenarios Structure

### Given/When/Then Pattern
```gherkin
**Given** [initial state/preconditions]
**When** [action performed]
**Then** [expected result]
**And** [additional conditions]
```

### Types of Scenarios to Include

#### Happy Path (Main Scenario)
- Normal flow without errors
- Valid data and optimal conditions
- Standard expected behavior

#### Alternative Flows
- Valid alternative paths
- Different user choices
- Alternative configurations

#### Error Scenarios
- Invalid inputs
- Error conditions
- Exception handling

#### Edge Cases
- Boundary values (min/max)
- Extreme conditions
- Rare but possible scenarios

## üîó Connections with Other Artifacts

### Input for Functional AC
- **Requirements (REQ-F-XXX)**: Functional requirements to be validated
- **User Stories (US-XXX)**: Implemented user stories
- **Use Cases (UC-XXX)**: System use cases
- **Business Rules**: Business rules to be applied

### Output of Functional AC
- **Test Cases**: Detailed test cases for QA
- **Test Scripts**: Automated test scripts
- **Test Data**: Data needed for execution
- **Defect Reports**: Bug reports if criteria are not met

## üìä Success Metrics

### Coverage Metrics
- **Requirement Coverage**: % of requirements with defined AC
- **Scenario Coverage**: % of business scenarios covered
- **Branch Coverage**: % of logical branches tested

### Quality Metrics
- **Pass Rate**: % of AC that pass on the first attempt
- **Defect Detection**: % of defects found through AC
- **Rework Rate**: % of AC that require changes

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Test Execution Time**: Average execution time of AC
- **Automation Rate**: % of automated AC
- **Maintenance Effort**: Effort to maintain AC

## üí° Best Practices

### During Definition
1. **Involve the Product Owner** for business validation
2. **Use concrete examples** instead of abstract descriptions
3. **Maintain atomicity** - one AC for one behavior
4. **Avoid implementation details** - focus on behavior
5. **Consider the end-user** - value for the business

### During Implementation
1. **Update AC** if requirements change
2. **Validate frequently** with stakeholders
3. **Document deviations** and rationale
4. **Maintain traceability** during development
5. **Prepare evidence** for acceptance testing

### During Testing
1. **Execute AC in order** of business priority
2. **Document all results** accurately
3. **Involve business users** in validation
4. **Manage failures** with a structured process
5. **Obtain formal sign-off** before release

## üîÑ Lifecycle Process

- Preparation of test data

### 3. Testing Phase
- Execution of manual tests
- Automation where possible
- Reporting of results
- Issue resolution

### 4. Acceptance Phase
- Business user validation
- Stakeholder sign-off
- Documentation update
- Lessons learned
