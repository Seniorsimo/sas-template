# Integrations

This folder contains the requirements for integrations with external systems and third-party services.

## üìã Overview

**Integration** requirements define how the system should interact with external systems, third-party APIs, cloud services, and legacy systems.

## üîå Types of Integrations

### Third-Party APIs
- Payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- Communication services (Twilio, SendGrid)
- Authentication services (OAuth providers)
- Mapping services (Google Maps, etc.)

### Legacy Systems
- Legacy databases
- Existing enterprise applications
- Mainframe systems
- File systems

### Cloud Services
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob)
- Messaging services (SQS, Service Bus)
- Monitoring services (CloudWatch, etc.)
- CDN and caching services

### External Databases
- Data warehouses
- Analytics systems
- Partner databases
- Master data management

## üìÅ File Structure

### Template Naming
`REQ-I-XXX-[integration-name].md`

### Examples
- `REQ-I-001-payment-gateway.md`
- `REQ-I-002-email-service.md`
- `REQ-I-003-legacy-crm.md`
- `REQ-I-004-cloud-storage.md`

## üìä Categorization by Criticality

### Critical (Must Have)
- [ ] Essential integrations for core business
- [ ] Payment systems
- [ ] Authentication services
- [ ] Main databases

### Important (Should Have)
- [ ] Notification services
- [ ] Monitoring systems
- [ ] Backup services
- [ ] Analytics platforms

### Optional (Could Have)
- [ ] Recommendation services
- [ ] Social media integrations
- [ ] Advanced analytics
- [ ] Marketing tools

## üîß Technical Aspects to Consider

### Communication Protocols
- **REST API**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- **GraphQL**: Queries and mutations
- **SOAP**: Legacy web services
- **Message Queues**: Async communication
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven integration

### Security
- **API Keys**: Management and rotation
- **OAuth 2.0**: Authorization flows
- **JWT Tokens**: Validation and refresh
- **SSL/TLS**: Encryption in transit
- **IP Whitelisting**: Network security

### Error Handling
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance
- **Timeout Management**: Response time limits
- **Fallback Strategies**: Graceful degradation

### Monitoring
- **Health Checks**: Service availability
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times
- **Error Rates**: Success/failure tracking
- **SLA Monitoring**: Service level compliance

- Documentation

## üìä Dependencies Matrix

| Integration | Core Features | Other Systems | Criticality |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| REQ-I-001   | REQ-F-001, REQ-F-003 | REQ-I-002     | High        |
| REQ-I-002   | REQ-F-002     | -             | Medium      |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Risks

### Availability
- Downtime of the external service
- Uncommunicated changes
- Unexpected rate limiting

### Security
- Breach of the third-party service
- Credential exposure
- Data leakage

### Performance
- Network latency
- Bottlenecks on external services
- Cascading failures

### Business
- Pricing changes
- Discontinuation of the service
- Vendor lock-in

## üí° Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- **Implement circuit breakers** for fault tolerance
- **Use retry logic** with exponential backoff
- **Continuously monitor** integrations
- **Accurately document** API contracts
- **Test failure scenarios**

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- **Don't make assumptions** about availability
- **Don't ignore rate limits**
- **Don't hardcode** credentials
- **Don't neglect** security
- **Don't forget** monitoring

*Integrations are often the most fragile part of the system. Design them with resilience and adequate monitoring.*
