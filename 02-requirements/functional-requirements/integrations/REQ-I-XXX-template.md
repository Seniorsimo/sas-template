## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: Successful Integration - Happy Path
**Given** both systems are operational and correctly configured
**And** authentication credentials are valid
**And** input data is in the correct format
**When** an integration request is sent
**Then** the data must be transferred correctly
**And** the response must be received within [X] seconds
**And** the mapped data must match the specifications
**And** the status code must indicate success

### Scenario 2: Authentication Failure
**Given** the target system is operational
**And** authentication credentials are invalid or expired
**When** a connection is attempted
**Then** an authentication error must be returned
**And** the error must be logged appropriately
**And** no sensitive information should be exposed in the error
**And** an alert must be triggered for the operations team

### Scenario 3: Data Validation Error
**Given** the connection is established correctly
**And** the input data does not respect the required schema
**When** the request is sent
**Then** a specific validation error must be returned
**And** the error message must clearly identify the problematic field
**And** the transaction must not be partially processed
**And** the error must be logged for troubleshooting

### Scenario 4: System Unavailability
**Given** the source system is operational
**And** the target system is temporarily unavailable
**When** communication is attempted
**Then** unavailability must be detected
**And** the configured retry logic must be activated
**And** appropriate alerts must be generated
**And** the data must be preserved for subsequent retries

### Scenario 5: Network Timeout
**Given** both systems are operational
**And** a network timeout occurs during communication
**When** the timeout is reached
**Then** the request must be interrupted
**And** a timeout error must be returned
**And** a retry must be attempted if configured
**And** the situation must be monitored
