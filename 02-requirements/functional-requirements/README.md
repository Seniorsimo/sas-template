## 🔗 Traceability

### Forward Traceability
Requirements → User Stories → Test Cases → Code

### Backward Traceability
Code → Test Cases → User Stories → Requirements → Business Objectives

### Horizontal Traceability
Requirements ↔ Architecture ↔ Design ↔ Implementation

## 📋 Traceability Matrix

| Requirement | User Stories | Use Cases | Test Cases | Implemented |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| REQ-F-001   | US-001, US-002 | UC-001    | TC-001, TC-002 | ✅          |
| REQ-F-002   | US-003       | UC-002    | TC-003     | ⏳          |

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- **Write specific** and measurable requirements
- **Use clear** and unambiguous language
- **Maintain traceability** with user stories and objectives
- **Version requirements** to track changes
- **Involve stakeholders** in the review

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't mix** functional and non-functional requirements
- **Don't be vague** or generic in descriptions
- **Don't forget** prioritization
- **Don't omit** acceptance criteria
- **Don't ignore** dependencies between requirements

## 🔄 Management Process

### 1. Identification
- Analysis of business objectives
- Workshop with stakeholders
- Derivation from user stories

### 2. Documentation
- Use of a standardized template
- Definition of acceptance criteria
- Identification of dependencies

### 3. Review and Approval
- Technical review
- Stakeholder approval
- Requirements baseline

### 4. Change Management
- Change request process
- Impact analysis
- Re-baseline when necessary
