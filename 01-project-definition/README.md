# Project Definition

This section contains the basic documentation to clearly define the software project. All files are **templates** to be customized for your specific project.

## 📁 Included Template Files

### 📄 project-description.md
Template for a complete project description that includes:
- **General overview** of the project
- **Problem to be solved** and context
- **Proposed solution** and approach
- **Expected benefits** and business value

### 👥 stakeholders.md
Template for stakeholder identification and analysis:
- **Primary stakeholders** (Product Owner, End Users)
- **Secondary stakeholders** (Development Team, Operations, Security)
- **External stakeholders** (Suppliers, Partners, Regulatory Bodies)
- **Stakeholder matrix** and communication plan

### 🎯 objectives.md
Template for defining project objectives:
- **Business objectives** (primary and secondary)
- **Technical objectives** (performance, scalability, security)
- **Quality objectives** (usability, reliability, portability)
- **Success metrics** and KPIs

### 📏 project-scope.md
Template for defining the project scope:
- **Scope statement** and justification
- **In scope**: features, modules, integrations included
- **Out of scope**: what will NOT be included
- **Constraints** (technical, time, budget, organizational)
- **High-level Work Breakdown Structure**

### ⚠️ risk-register.md
Template for the project risk register:
- **Risk Matrix** with probability/impact scale
- **Risk categorization** by category and priority
- **Mitigation strategies** and contingency plans
- **Risk management process** and escalation

## 🚀 How to Use These Templates

### 1. Recommended Completion Order
```
1. project-description.md    → Define the WHAT and WHY
2. stakeholders.md          → Identify WHO is involved
3. objectives.md            → Establish WHAT you want to achieve
4. project-scope.md         → Delimit WHAT you will and will NOT do
5. risk-register.md         → Anticipate WHAT could go wrong
```

### 2. Customization
For each template file:
- 🔍 **Find and replace** all placeholders `[Project Name]`, `[Description]`, etc.
- ✏️ **Fill in the sections** with information specific to your project
- 🗑️ **Remove sections** not applicable to your context
- ➕ **Add specific sections** if necessary

### 3. Iteration and Refinement
- 🔄 **Regularly review** these documents during the project
- 📝 **Update** when requirements or context change
- ✅ **Maintain alignment** between all documents
- 📊 **Track changes** and versions

## 📋 Completion Checklist

Before proceeding to the next phase (`02-requirements`), ensure you have completed:

- [ ] **Project Description**: Clear description of the problem, solution, and benefits
- [ ] **Stakeholders**: Complete identification of all stakeholders with roles and responsibilities
- [ ] **Objectives**: SMART objectives defined with success metrics
- [ ] **Project Scope**: Clear boundaries of what is included and excluded
- [ ] **Risk Register**: Identification of main risks with mitigation plans
- [ ] **Approval**: All documents approved by key stakeholders

## 🔗 Connection with Other Sections

### Input for Subsequent Phases:
- **02-requirements**: The defined objectives will guide the requirements gathering
- **03-behavioral-diagrams**: The identified stakeholders will become actors in the use cases
- **04-structural-diagrams**: The scope defines the modules to be designed
- **05-database-design**: Business requirements guide the database design

### Traceability:
- Each requirement must be traceable to the objectives
- Each use case must serve at least one stakeholder
- Each component must be within the defined scope

## 💡 Best Practices

### ✅ Do's
- **Involve stakeholders** in the definition and review
- **Be specific** in descriptions and avoid generalities
- **Use quantifiable metrics** where possible
- **Keep documents concise** but complete
- **Version all documents** to track changes

### ❌ Don'ts
- **Don't make assumptions** without documenting them
- **Don't define a scope that is too broad** for the first release
- **Don't neglect risks** even if they seem unlikely
- **Don't proceed** without formal approval
- **Don't forget** to update the documents during the project

## 📞 Next Steps

Once the project definition is complete:

1. **Formal review** with all key stakeholders
2. **Document approval** (formal sign-off)
3. **Project kick-off** with the development team
4. **Transition** to the requirements gathering phase (`02-requirements/`)

*These templates provide a solid foundation for defining any software project. Customize them according to the specific needs of your project and organization.*
